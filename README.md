    * If you would like to select a different vehicle you can return to the first promt. As you can see my F-150 was added now to the options for an existing vehicle

## Vehicle Actions
Each vehicle type handles actions differently, just like they would on the road
### Trucks
If you select a truck as your vehicle you have the option to perform the `Tow` action that is only available for this vehicle type
* Select `Tow` in the list of actions
* Next select which vehicle from the list you would like to tow

* If the weight is less than the maximun towing capacity of the truck selected you will see in the command line that your selected vehicle is now being towed 
* Then you are free to perform another action with your truck 

### Motorbikes
Motorbikes have the special ability to perform a Wheelie, unlike a truck or car

* Select an existing Motorbike or input the specifications just like for truck
